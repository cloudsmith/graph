The graph package is a java/osgi layout package using graphviz as a rendering engine.
The package contains an abstraction of Graph, Vertex and Edge and has a Graph Cascading Style Sheet (GCSS)
implementation that makes it easy to separate graph structure from styling information.

The package requires graphviz to be installed on the host where the package is running in order to
produce PNG, JPG, SVG, (and more formats) output, but can be used to produce .dot output without graphviz
binary being present. 

Configuration is done using google guice.
